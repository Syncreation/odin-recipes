    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Ah, Chicken Parmesan... I remember back in the country side, my italian grandmother would serve us a steaming
        plate of her delectable Chicken Parmesan on an hourly basis. There was no such thing as too much to her, and any
        and all protests would be met with a hot spoonful of saucy breaded chicken to the objecting area. I spent many
        years of my young adulthood exploring different types of cusines, but due to the culinary stockholm syndrome I
        developed back then, I was never able to satisfy myself.

        This dish is one I concocted based on the few dusty pages of her cookbook I was able to extract from her tomb. 
        With a little special twist of my own, of course. Chicken Parmesan is a fun treat for the whole family, and its
        only after serving it to my own family that I finally understood what was going on in my grandmother's head. I am
        filled with an unhinged rage whenever my 2 year old son does not finish his 3 lb plate of the dish I spent the last
        3 hours making, and I will not allow that impudence to stand.
